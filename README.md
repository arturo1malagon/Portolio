# Portolio
## This is the first release of my portfolio. In this release I included three projects: Pacmen, Eyes and Real Bus tracking simulator. Each one of the three projects was developed using HTML, JS and CSS files. 
## It's important to notice that also I used a Bootstrap template as the baseline of this landing page.
